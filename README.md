# WeatherWise
metry is an app that helps people plan outdoor activities by showing what the weather is likely to be at any place and time of the year.

It doesn’t give a short-term forecast. Instead, it uses NASA’s historical weather data to tell users the chances of having very hot, cold, rainy, windy, or uncomfortable weather.

Users can pick a location on a map and select a date, and the app shows:

The average weather conditions for that time,

The probability of extreme conditions,

And clear charts or text summaries to make it easy to understand.

This helps travelers, hikers, and event planners choose the best time and place for their activities — based on real NASA Earth observation data.
